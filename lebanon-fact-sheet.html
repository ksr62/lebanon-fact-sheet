      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>In 1920, the French demarcated the region of Lebanon. On November 22nd, the region officially achieved independence becoming the Lebanese Republic. However, from 1975 to 1990, the country underwent a civil war followed by years of social, political, and economic instability. </p>

      <p>Physically, Lebanon is about one-third the size of the state of Maryland and is the smallest country in continental Asia. Located in the Middle East, Lebanon borders the Mediterranean Sea between Israel and Syria. Syria has historically been an influence on Lebanonâ€™s foreign and domestic policies with its military occupying the nation from 1976 to 2005. Lebanon's borders with Israel and Syria still remain unresolved.</p>
