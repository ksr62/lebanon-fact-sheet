        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>In <time datetime="1920">1920</time>, the French demarcated the region of Lebanon.

Located in the Middle East, Lebanon borders the Mediterranean Sea between Israel and Syria.

        <p>Lebanon's borders with Israel and Syria still remain unresolved. You can learn more about Lebanon's politcal history, background, and current climate <a href="https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/lebanon/#introduction"> here.</a></p>

        <p>The capital of Lebanon is <b>Beirut</b>, a small peninsula whose city is bounded eastwards by the mountainous interior of the country. For over 5,000 years, Beirut has been an urban center and a focus of military and economic conflicts with its neighboring city-states.</p>
